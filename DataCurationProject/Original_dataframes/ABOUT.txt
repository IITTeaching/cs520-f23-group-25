These dataframes aren't exactly the original from the movieLens dataset. We decided to synthetically add ambiguity in some of the .csv in order to make the integration process
more realistic, this was done in changing the way the foreign keys were being represented.
	EXAMPLE
	In ratings, userId is an integer (1, 2, 3...) and movieId as well.
	In movies, userId is a string (userId 1, userId 2 ...)
	In tags userId and movieId are combined in one column in the form of: "userId|movieId" (String)
